  <div class='newage_bs'>You and I are dreamweavers of the planet. By awakening, we vibrate. Transcendence is the driver of rejuvenation.
    Awareness is a constant. Serenity is the growth of starfire, and of us. This life is nothing short of a condensing fount of mystical interconnectedness.
        We exist as sonar energy.
    Presence requires exploration. To go along the myth is to become one with it. Nothing is impossible.</div>
