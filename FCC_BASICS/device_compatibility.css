    @media (min-height: 350px) {
        font-size: 12px;

make image adapt to device: 
    img {
        max-width: 100%;

    <style>
        img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
    </style>

set sizes as a percentage of the display size:
vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
ex:
    body { width: 30vw; }
