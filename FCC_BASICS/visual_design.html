--------> TEXT 
    text-align: justify; // right/left/center
    font-size: 27px;
bold text in css:
    font-weight: bold; //bold text. Or can be a value from 100 to 1000
or in html: 
    <p>blabla <strong>bla</strong></p>

Text transform:
    text-transform: lowercase; //uppercase/capitalize/initial(=default)/inherit(=parent value)

Space between lines:
    line-height: 25px;

underline:
    text-decoration: underline; 
or
    <p>blabla <u>bla</u></p>

italic:
    font-style: italic; 
or
    <p>blabla <em>bla</em></p>

striked text:
    text-decoration: line-through;; 
or
    <p>blabla <s>bla</s></p>

--------> SIZE OF THE ELEMENT
    width: 5em;
    height: 20px;

    p:hoover {
        transform: scale(2); // doubles element size upon hoovering
      }
    Skew element on its axis:  
        transform: skewX(-32deg);
        transform: skewY(-3deg);
      

--------> DECORATION
horizontal line in html:
    <hr>

box shadow: add a shadow to element box
(offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius, color)
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);

--------> PSEUDO-CLASSES
Depend on the state of an element.
a:hover {
    color: red;
  }
  
--------> ELEMENT POSITION
Relative:
    If relative, is set relatively to the element (here, 10px further from 
    bottom). It is an OFFSET (it moves the element away from the other element)
    (or top/left/right).
    The document's normal flow is maintained and other elements will be 
    moved as well.
        p {
            position: relative;
            bottom: 10px;
        }

Absolute:
    Locks the elements to its closest positioned ancestor (parent must
    have position: relative;). Will be ignored by other elems, element
    is removed from the normal flow
    #searchbar {
        position: relative;
        top: 10px;
        right: 10px;
    }

    Fixed:
        like absolute, but element doesn't even move when scrolling
    #navbar {
        position: fixed;
        top: 10px;
        left: 10px;
    }   

Float: left or right. Pushed element to that side.
#right {
    float: right;
    width: 50%;
  }

Order overlapping elements: z-index 
    #bla {
        z-index: 2;
    }
    #blou {
        z-index: 1;
    }

Center element:
    margin: auto; //works for images too, by adding display: block; so they're treated as a block

--------> COLOR
hsl(degree, saturation, lightness) 
(degree is on the color wheel, ex 170)
    background-color: hsl(180, 90%, 35%);

Gradient: (direction in degrees, ex 68deg)
    background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);

Repeating gradient (ex: stripes)
    repeating-linear-gradient(
        90deg, //direction
        yellow 0px,
        blue 40px,
        green 40px,
        red 80px
        );

Set an image as background: 
background: url(https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/imgr/MJAkxbh.png);

--------> COLOR THEORY:
Complementary colours pop.

The split-complementary color scheme: starts with a base color, 
then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its 
complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a
design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.

!Careful! have high enough contrast for accessibility.
Careful with colours hard to distinguished for colorblinds (green vs yellow/brown vs yellow)

--------> SHAPES:
css can be used to make shapes, by modifying a box's appearance.

::before and ::after are pseudo elements which add an element to an element.
ex: heart {
        blabla: shape;  
    }
    heart::before {
        blabla: rectangle shape;
    }

--------> ANIMATIONS:

Keyframes:
    #anim {
        animation-name: colorful;
        animation-duration: 3s;
        animation-fill-mode: forwards; //allows anim not to stop
        animation-iteration-count: 3; //nb of iterations. Can be "infinite"
        animation-timing-function: ease; //ease by default. can 
            // be linear, ease-in, ease-out. (=type of movement acceleration)
            //can be set to a bezier curve such as 
            // animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75);
    }
    
    @keyframes colorful {
        0% {//beginning of anim
        background-color: blue;
        }
        100% {//end of anim
        background-color: yellow;
        }
    }

Can be used to change width of hoovered elem: 
    <style>
        img:hover {
        animation-name: width;
        animation-duration: 500ms;
        }
    
        @keyframes width {
            100% {
                width: 40px;
            }
        }
    </style>

Move elem around and change its color:
    @keyframes rainbow {
        0% {
            background-color: blue;
            top: 0px;
        }
        50% {
            background-color: green;
            top: 50px;
        }
        100% {
            background-color: yellow;
            top: 0px;
        }
    }

Fade elem as it moves:
    @keyframes fade {
        50% {
        left: 60%;

        }
    }
